## I don't see an icon or label that I want?
You have two options:

1. You can create an icon and place it in ***\Icons\Filters*** for Icons in the theme folder
- However you will need to backup your icons as every time the theme is updated it will overwrite the icons in that folder

2. You can raise a request for a new icon/platform/logo **[here](https://github.com/TheKersalMassive/ReskinPS5/issues)**
- Create a **New Issue** and/or attach your icon if you want it added to the theme. Each icon submission will be reviewed and needs to match the general scheme and aesthtic of the theme

## How do I get the launcher below the game title when a game is selected?
This is based on the **'Source'** field, if you want to show 'Steam', 'Ubisoft' or 'Yuzu' as in the above screenshot, you will need to set these sources in the source field of your game(s).

## Can you add support for any extensions or add-ons?
No as I don't use any extensions (apart from Extra Metadata Loader), plugins or add-ons. However, you can always fork and mod the theme if you prefer.

## I want to show game logos in the Game Details view
You can either add game logos as an icon or you can use Extra Metadata Loader addon **[here](https://playnite.link/forum/thread-814.html)**

## I want to request a feature or report a bug
